[Material Theme Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons) are recommended to go with the daily-coder theme.

Special thanks to [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato), because I used his awesome [monokai night theme](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night) configuration as a starting point for daily-coder!
