# Daily Coder

A **blue-yellow** color theme for everyone who wants to work within a productive environment.

Highlights:

- Low contrast colors
- Designed for long coding sessions
- We took colors from the face of a pretty lady to create this theme

- If you need any change, you can open an issue or pull request on Github
- [Material Theme Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons) are recommended to go with the daily-coder theme.

This theme is mostly tested with React and NodeJS. If a feature or language is not well colorized, please open an issue! :)

Special thanks to [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato), because I used his awesome [monokai night theme](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night) configuration as a starting point for daily-coder!
