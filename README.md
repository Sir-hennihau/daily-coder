# Daily Coder

A **blue yellow** color theme for everyone who wants to work within a productive environment.

Inspired by [Ricardo Garces](https://twitter.com/artblogmunich?lang=en) "Blue and Yellow Woman"

[Material Theme Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme-icons) are recommended to go with the Daily Coder theme.

This theme is mostly tested with React and NodeJS. If a feature or language is not well colorized, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Sir-hennihau/daily-coder/issues)! :)

Special thanks to [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato), because I used his awesome [monokai night theme](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night) configuration as a starting point for Daily Coder!
